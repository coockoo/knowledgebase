# Programming

## Values of a good programmer

This is an evolving opinionated list of nice to have things.

- product first;
  - selecting not ideal tool for building the product is fine;
  - don't let the process prevail over product;
  - talk to users;
- deliver fast;
  - some things, like user data privacy or security are exceptions;
  - raw unfinished working product is better than state-of-the-art one in the archive;
- iterate fast till perfection;
  - environment, metrics, team communication should be optimized;
- straight and direct feedback;
  - does not assume being rude; don't be an asshole;
  - even joke-like toxicity can be a small crack towards canyon;

## Books

- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](./sicp.md)

## Functional Programming

Has it's own [section](./functional.md)

## Nice to read articles

- [The Grug Brained Developer][grug] from creator of HTMX;

  Great article about complexity in software development.
  Narrated in the funny manner from the Grug, who is convinced that "complexity very, very bad".

  Not much educational, but rather entertaining and thought provoking.

## Web
