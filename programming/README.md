## Values of a good programmer

This is an evolving opinionated list of nice to have things.

- product first;
  - selecting not ideal tool for building the product is fine;
  - don't let the process prevail over product;
  - talk to users;
- deliver fast;
  - some things, like user data privacy or security are exceptions;
  - raw unfinished working product is better than state-of-the-art one in the archive;
- iterate fast till perfection;
  - environment, metrics, team communication should be optimized;
- straight and direct feedback;
  - does not assume being rude; don't be an asshole;
  - even joke-like toxicity can be a small crack towards canyon;
