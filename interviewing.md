# Interviewing

*Disclaimer: none of the content of this file was produced by LLM. Handmade in Ukraine with love.*

You are not the main character.

Your task as an interviewer is to open candidate,
let him show his strong sides and try to understand weak ones.

*Describe this process in the form of interviewing imaginary Danylo that wants to join your company.*

## Ideal Interview

Ideal technical interview in my opinion is an open GitHub profile with some contribution in it.
This can give understanding what kind of problems person is solving, how he solves them, what technologies he uses,
how often he solves them, how deeply this person delves (yes, I actually used this word) into technology.

## Setup

The goal of this phase is to kickstart the whole interview. 
Set a friendly tone and just start talking. Talking reduces stress
in candidate as well as in the interviewer.

When I'm on the stage, the first couple of minutes is like hell,
but after the initial fear is gone, it's just rolling.
(Considering that you are prepared or gifted, but that's a topic for 
another time).

### Possible plan

- meet and greet;
- ask to continue talking in less formal way;
- set agenda;
- let candidate know that this will be a **conversation**;
- talk through agenda;

Last point is important, as unknown usually scares, this means stress.
And we don't want stress here.

## What To Look For

Once again, you are not the main character here.

Don't try to solve tasks for candidate, don't try to answer your questions after candidate fails to answer.

Make candidate think, make him do step by step reasoning, make him "solve" challenges.
Look for the process and not for the result. Since solving interviewing challenges is not always as
day-to-day work, there might be some rustiness.

Try to dive deeper into candidate's answers. Make candidate explain why he used this thing,
why this thing works, why this and not that.

## What to Ask

Don't ask for things that you don't know. Be ready to answer your own answers clearly.

## After the Interview

Be open to feedback from candidate and your interviewing colleague.
Don't treat it as a call to action, but like a food for though.
