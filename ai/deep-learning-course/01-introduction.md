# Introduction

For recognition of objects:

- define parametric model;
- optimize parameters by "making it work on training data";

Deep learning â€“ model with billions of parameters.

Deep learning:

- chain rule (backpropagation);
- stochastic gradient descent;
- convolutions;

  **Convolution** is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal

- parallel operation on GPUs;

## Tensor

Generalized matrix.

Tensors are used to encode the signal to process, but also the internal states and parameters of models.

```sh
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

## Footnotes

Nothing interesting in particular, a bunch of overview information.
