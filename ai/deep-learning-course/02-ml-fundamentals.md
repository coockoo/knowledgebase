# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Loss and risk

Capture regularity in data to make predictions.

3 Categories:

- classification: recognition, detection, speech processing;
- regression: stock prediction, customer satisfaction;
- density estimation: outlier detection (spam filter?), sampling, synthesis;

Classification and regression â€“ measure of probability $\mu_{X,Y}$ over the bservation/value of interest.
Where $(x_n, y_n), n = 1, ..., N$.

And for density estimation $\mu_X$ where $x_n, n = 1, ..., N$

Ok, I feel like I'm lost already. I think I need to improve some gaps in the probability and come back here.
