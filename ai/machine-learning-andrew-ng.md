# Machine Learning

Based on the [course][mlcourse] by Andrew Ng. Started in Autumn 2018.

This is the course that was shoved into my recommendations over and over again.
It feels like Andrew is my relative or something.
I'm delighted that this course if freely available on YT. Very cool.

## Lecture 01

AI is the new electricity. It will disrupt a lot of spheres. Demand is high.

Supervised learning

Given dataset (x, y), find a mapping x -> y.

Regression problem. Y is continious. Raw numbers

Classification problem. Y is a discrete number. Discrete output.

For most ML problems X is multidementional.
Unfortunately, this cannot be plotted (for visualization).

Support vector machine algorithms works with infinite dimension of vector.

Unsupervised learning â€“ give structure to unstructured data. Get insights from data.
