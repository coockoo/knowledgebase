# How to be More Agentic

[Article][article] by Cate Hall

Radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do
that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant.

**Court rejection**. I’m planning to start an organization similar to yours;
would you consider letting me run yours instead?

**Seek real feedback**. Anonymous is good.

**Increase your surface area for luck**.
Meeting as many people doing related work as I could,
even if there was no obvious benefit to doing so.

**Assume everything is learnable**. Charisma too.

**Learn to love the moat of low status**.
If you can learn to thrive in the moat, it’s incredibly liberating.

_note: moat - a deep, wide ditch surrounding a castle,
fort, or town, typically filled with water and intended as a defence against attack._

**Don’t work too hard**. Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer.
